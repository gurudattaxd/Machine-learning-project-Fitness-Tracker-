# Barbell Exercise Repetition Counter

This machine learning project is designed to predict and analyze fitness levels using several health-related metrics. We use multiple machine learning models to determine the effectiveness and accuracy of multiple feature sets in predicting fitness scores. The project enables people to monitor their fitness progress and make informed health decisions.


**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

1) Converting raw data, reading CSV files, spliting and cleaning data
2) Visualizing data, Plotting time series data.
3) Outlier detection
4) Feature engineering, LowPass filter, Principal Component Analysis, Clustering
5) Chosing appropriate model
6) Counting repetitions

### **Observations:**
- Random Forest (RF) and Neural Networks (NN) achieved the highest accuracy.
- KNN performed poorly with some feature sets, making it unsuitable for deployment.
- Feature Set 4 and Selected Features provided the most consistent and high-performing results.
- Naive Bayes (NB) showed moderate accuracy but underperformed compared to RF and NN.

Based on these findings, **Random Forest and Neural Networks were the top contenders for fitness prediction**, with RF being the best choice for deployment.
